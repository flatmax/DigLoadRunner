# Dig Load Runner : Effector Generator

A VCV plugin.

Let me give you a quick overview of the DigLoadRunner module.

The 5 buttons at the top are presets that set various modes for the module. Once you’ve selected a mode, you can tweak the knobs to explore and customize the sound.

The module serves two primary functions:

* Effector: It can process input signals with a variety of effects, including delay, chorus, notching, peaking, multi-pole peaking, and more—depending on the knob settings.
* Generator: It can generate its own signals, such as impulsive rings (percussive sounds), noise, and unique comb- and notch-like synthesis sounds. Additionally, it includes delay functionality. By default, the generated signals are routed through the effector.
